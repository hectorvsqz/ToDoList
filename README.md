# ToDoList
Simple ToDo list made using React Library

# Project Description
This is a simple to do list application.
To add an item to the list, simply start entering ToDos in the text input box, and press enter.
To remove an item, simply click on that item.

This app was built using the React library to learn about how the useState Hook can be used to update the state of variables and separate UI components from application logic. The challenging part for me in this project was understanding how hooks work.

As this is just a simple app, surely many improvements can be made, like a better UI, persistance of the list items, currently the items are not saved in a database, for example. Also the way the items are deleted with simple click is not ideal. One can prompt the user to confirm deletion, for example.

# How to run
Download all the files, in the same folder, then click on the html file, index.html. We use Babel and call all the libraries inside the html file so it should run on your browser.
